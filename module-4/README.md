# 🚀 Module 4 – Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

## 📖 Introduction

Blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`<=`) assignments are fundamental concepts in Verilog HDL that determine how statements execute within procedural blocks. Proper use of these assignment operators is essential for designing reliable and synthesizable digital circuits. This module demonstrates the implementation of multiplexers, the behavior of blocking assignments, and common synthesis-simulation mismatch scenarios. The designs are simulated using Icarus Verilog, analyzed using GTKWave, synthesized using Yosys, and mapped to the SKY130 standard-cell library.

# 1️⃣ RTL Simulation of a 2×1 Multiplexer

## 📖 Overview

A 2×1 multiplexer was implemented using the Verilog ternary operator to understand combinational logic design. The RTL design was simulated using Icarus Verilog, and the output waveform was verified using GTKWave. The experiment demonstrates how the output changes based on the select signal and validates the functional correctness of the multiplexer before synthesis.

# 4️⃣ Analysis of an Incorrect Multiplexer Design

## 📖  Overview

This experiment demonstrates an improperly coded multiplexer that leads to synthesis-simulation mismatch. Incomplete assignments inside the always block may infer latches during synthesis, resulting in hardware behavior different from RTL simulation.



### ⚙️ Simulation Commands
```bash

### ✅ Observation

The incorrect coding style produced unexpected output behavior during simulation.

---

# 5️⃣ Verification of Bad Multiplexer Behavior

## 📖 Overview

The waveform illustrates the behavior of the incorrectly implemented multiplexer. Missing assignments cause previous output values to be retained, resulting in latch inference and mismatch between simulation and synthesized hardware.

### ⚙️ Simulation Commands

## 8️⃣ Blocking Assignment Using Past Value

This experiment demonstrates how blocking assignments (=) use the updated value immediately within the same procedural block. The simulation illustrates how the output depends on the sequence of statements and the previously assigned values. This helps in understanding the behavior of blocking assignments and why they can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used in sequential logic. Therefore, blocking assignments are generally recommended for combinational logic, while non-blocking assignments (<=) are preferred for sequential circuits.

### ⚙️ Commands
```bash
iverilog -o blocking_past blocking_caveat.v tb_blocking_caveat.v

gtkwave blocking_caveat.vcd
```
🖼️ Output

✅ Result
The waveform shows that blocking assignments execute sequentially and immediately update variable values within the same procedural block. This demonstrates how statement ordering influences simulation behavior and highlights the importance of using blocking assignments appropriately.

# 🎯 Overall Result
